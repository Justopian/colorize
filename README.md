# colorize
This program was created for the AP Computer Science Fundamentals course.
It is a small game with the goal of matching a color with a randomly generated color using only randomly-generated values.
As such, this game is not very fun, but it implements Swift in a visualling appealing way, if I may so myself.

More details on the game are in the report, and a video (.mov file) shows the functionality.

Because this program uses Swift, it is not able to be run if the operating system is not MacOS.
